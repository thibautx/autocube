					<p><b>What About “Cookies”?</b><br />

					<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but they also offer a user the ability to block them. Doing so may prevent you from using some of the features of our Sites. Instructions for blocking cookies can be found in your browser help tab. You can also learn more about how cookies and other technologies are used to target advertisements to your browser at <b>www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising</b>.

					<p><b>What are the Site’s security practices?</b><br />
						We have implemented certain measures to help protect your user Information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

					<p><b>Your California Privacy Rights</b></p>

					<p>It is High Gear Media’s policy to share personal information only with the user’s informed consent unless otherwise specified in this privacy policy. With your consent, from time-to-time, CCJ Tech, LLC may provide its business partners with contact details for direct marketing purposes of relevant services, products, and programs. California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please let us know using this <b>contact us form</b>. You may also let us know at this number that you no longer wish your information to be shared.</p>

					<p><b>How we respond to Do Not Track Disclosures</b>.</p>

					<p>Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Because these features are not yet uniform, we are not currently set up to respond to “do not track” signals. Our information and disclosure practices will continue to apply as described in this privacy policy regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that are sent by certain browsers.</p>
